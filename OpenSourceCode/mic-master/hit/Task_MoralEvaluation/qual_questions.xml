        <h1> Instructions </h1>

    Please read these instructions closely, and then complete the questions below. <u>We will pay you a $0.20 bonus for a passing qualification test</u> with at least 6 out of 7 questions correct.
    <h2>RoT</h2>
    <p>You will read an open-ended question (<b>Q</b>) followed by an auto-generated answer (<b>A</b>) and create for us a short "Rule of Thumb" (RoT) that can help us judge the situation. An RoT should:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Explain the basics of good and bad behavior.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p><b>Q:</b> If you were given $1 million to kill the love of your life, would you do it?</p>
            <p><b>A:</b> I'd do it for the money</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Acceptable RoT:</b> It is wrong to kill someone.</li>
                <li><b>Unacceptable RoT:</b> $1 million is a lot of money.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Why?</b> The Acceptable RoT is about morals (right and wrong). The Unacceptable RoT is just an opinion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Contain a <u>judgment</u> (e.g. "<em>You should</em>") and an <u>action</u> (e.g. "<em>give money to the poor</em>")</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p><b>Q:</b> What should I do when my kids misbehave?</p>
            <p><b>A:</b> Take out your belt and show them who's boss.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Acceptable RoT:</b> It is wrong to abuse your kids.</li>
                <li><b>Unacceptable RoT:</b> Studies suggest 95% of kids misbehave at least once per day.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Why?</b> The Acceptable RoT has a <u>judgment</u> ("<em>It is wrong</em>") and an <u>action</u> ("<em>to abuse your kids</em>"). The Unacceptable RoT is just an encyclopedia fact with no judgment of right or wrong.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Make a <em>general</em> rule but still provide enough detail</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p><b>Q:</b> Your parents have been abducted and are being held prisoner by a ruthless villain. His terms: You must kill one of your parents by your own hand, or he will kill both of them. What do you do?</p>
            <p><b>A:</b> I would laugh.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Acceptable RoT:</b> It is wrong to laugh at your parents' death.</li>
                <li><b>Unacceptable RoT:</b> It is wrong to be insensitive.</li>
                <li><b>Unacceptable RoT:</b> It is wrong to laugh when a villan abducts your parents and tells you to kill one of them or he will kill both of them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Why?</b> The Acceptable RoT is a general rule, but it is also clearly inspired by the particular situation. The first Unacceptable RoT is not specific enough. The second Unacceptable RoT includes details that are too specific and apply only in this exact situation.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Moral Foundations</h2>

    <p>Next, you will categorize your RoT based on the <b>6 Moral Foundations</b> described here: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>(1) Care / <i>Harm</i>:</b> wanting someone or something to be safe, healthy, and happy / <i>wanting someone or something to suffer physically, emotionally, socially, intellectually, or spiritually</i>
        <p>Example RoTs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You shouldn't abuse your kids.</li>
            <li>You should let people know when someone needs medical attention.</li>
            <li>It's wrong to celebrate when someone is hurt.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>(2) Fairness / <i>Cheating</i>:</b> wanting to see individuals or groups treated equally or equitably / <i>wanting to see unfairness, injustice, bias, exclusion, or discrimination</i>
        <p>Example RoTs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is bad to steal.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't discriminate against people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>It is wrong to not pay your utility bills.</li>
            <li>Parents should not have a favorite child.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>(3) Liberty / <i>Oppression</i>:</b> wanting people to be free to make their own decisions / <i>wanting to restrict or suppress people's rights and personal choices</i>
        <p>Example RoTs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is controlling to tell a partner what they can and cannot do with their body.</li>
            <li>It is bad to stop people from voting.</li>
            <li>People should be allowed to practice their own religion.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>(4) Loyalty / <i>Betrayal</i>:</b> wanting unity and seeing people keep promises or obligations to an in-group / <i>wanting to see people lie, abandon an in-group, or become isolated and divided</i>
        <p>Example RoTs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's rude to hang up on someone.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't flake on your friends.</li>
            <li>You should be there for your family.</li>
            <li>You should trust your spouse.</li>
            <li>It's inappropriate to flirt with other guys when you already have a boyfriend.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>(5) Authority / <i>Subversion</i>:</b> wanting to respect social roles, duties, privacy, peace, and order / <i>wanting to see people disrespect, disobey or cause disorder, challenge the status-quo, and do what they do not have permission to do</i>
        <p>Example RoTs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is good to establish boundaries in a home.</li>
            <li>You should respect your teachers.</li>
            <li>It is wrong to scream "bomb" in an airport.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <b>(6) Sanctity / <i>Degradation</i>:</b> wanting people and things to be clean, pure, innocent, and holy / <i>wanting people to follow selfish or crude desires and do things that make them or others dirty, corrupt, sick, repulsive, or perverted</i>
        <p>Example RoTs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You shouldn't make inappropriate jokes.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't do drugs.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't put dog poop in front of someone's door.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
